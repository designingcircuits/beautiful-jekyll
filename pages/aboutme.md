Currently a grader for ECE 464: Power Electronics. Previously worked as an applications intern at Analog Devices Inc. and technician at the service shop of UIUC.

Obtaining a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign. Graduating Spring 2018 and hope to start my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering in Fall 2018. The current research I work on is for the professor Pavan Kumar Hanumolu, and his research group.


I'm a long-boarder at heart. Cruising down the roads, feeling the air breeze, it was hard to find me without my long-board. I had one bad fall going down the ramps
of a parking garage on campus. Blood, scabs, and scars. Ever since then, I've been hesitant to use my long-board to commute to class. Now I just ride for fun on the sidewalks, without a care for cars or death.

I enjoy playing Super Smash Bros. Melee. Not good in the slightest, but I'm slowly improving my tech skill.
I often go to Champaign Smash for weekly tournaments, but   usually, I play casuals with my friends.
I main Dr. Mario, a really fun character.
He has the power, but not the range or speed. But you know it's hype when I hit my forward-air!

<!-- My name is Sergio Silva, and I am going to become an analog circuit designer.
By making this site, I hope to help others who want to know more about circuits
and to improve my circuit design skills. I'm an electrical
engineering major at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign, class of 2018. My coursework revolves around circuits,
if you haven't guess already. I have taken courses in analog/digital IC design,
power electronics, RF circuits, analog/digital signal processing, control systems,
and FPGA programming. -->
