  My favorite place to eat is <strong>Chipotle</strong>. Bowl to go, extra brown rice, black and pinto beans, veggies, chicken, guac, and lettuce. Good tasting food that brings
  a big smile to my stomach. And don't get me started when they have the buy one, get one free deal!
  </p></li>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-gamepad fa-2x"></i><p>
  I enjoy playing <strong>Super Smash Bros. Melee</strong>. Not good in the slightest, but I'm slowly improving my tech skill.
  I attend <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/smashingillini/?fref=nf">Champaign Smash</a> for weekly tournaments, but   usually, I play casuals with my friends or online.
  I main Dr. Mario, a really fun character.
  He has the power, but not the range or speed. But you know it's hype when I hit my forward-air!
  </p></li>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-road fa-2x"></i><p>
  I'm a long-boarder at heart. Cruising down the roads, feeling the air breeze, it's hard to find me without my <a href="https://www.warehouseskateboards.com/landyachtz-tugboat-waves-complete-cruiser-skateboard-9.25x30">long-board</a>. I had few minor (and major) falls here and
  there, but nothing to keep me off the pavement.
  </p></li>

  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-file-text-o fa-2x"></i><p>
  I like to spend my free time working on various circuit projects and updating my <a href="/blog/"><strong>blog</strong></a> and <a href="/circuits/"><strong>circuits</strong></a> pages. These are good places to view my interests and work, but you can also view my <a href="/resume.pdf">resume</a>.
