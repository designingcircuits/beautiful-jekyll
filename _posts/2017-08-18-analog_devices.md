Today concludes my summer internship at Analog Devices Inc. at Greensboro, NC. I was an Applications
Engineering Intern for the Transceiver Products Group. I would like to thank my manager,
Shyam Nambiar, for giving me a great opportunity to improve my career and myself.

While I was there, I worked on creating a python test-bench that is able to characterize any given power amplifier (PA). To explain, first we have a power amplifier from any vendor. We want to know the behavior of the PA in order to integrate it in the overall system. This behavior includes characteristics such as gain and output power. By controlling signal generators and spectrum analyzers, we are able to  perform measurement tests on the PA. The benefit of automate the whole characterization process is that we can take a lot of data that would otherwise require some one to be manually change all the variables of the instruments.
