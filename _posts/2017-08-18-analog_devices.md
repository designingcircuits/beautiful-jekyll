Today concludes my summer internship at Analog Devices Inc. at Greensboro, NC. I was an Applications
Engineering Intern for the Transceiver Products Group. I would like to thank my manager,
Shyam Nambiar, for giving me a great opportunity to improve my career and myself.

While I was there, I worked on creating a python test-bench that is able to characterize any given power amplifier (PA). To explain, first we have a power amplifier from any vendor. We want to know the behavior of the PA in order to integrate it in the overall system. This behavior includes characteristics such as gain and output power. To achieve this, we need
to perform measurement tests on the PA which is achieved by automating instrumentation.
By writing scripts that control instruments, we can take alot of data and perform
the apppropiet test. An example test: for gain frequency response, we have to record the
gain for a frequency
