Welcome to Designing Circuits, a project in the making!

Hi, I'm Sergio, and I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, home to mid-western corn.
I'm currently a junior in electrical engineering, and I like circuits.
I knew I wanted to go into electrical engineering because I took physics in high school where I first learned about electrical circuits.
Resistors, capacitors, and inductors, and it all just seemed so fascinating, placing each
And I was good at math and science, not so much history and english, which made my choice clear.


I've had the idea to make a website for some while now, and I've finally started to take action.

I'd like to share my to inspire others who also have an interest in circuit design.

This is my journey in becoming a circuit designer.
