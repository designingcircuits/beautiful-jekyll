Welcome to Designing Circuits, a project in the making!

Hi, I'm Sergio, and I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, home to mid-western corn.
I'm currently a junior in electrical engineering, and I like circuits. You can read more about me [here](/aboutme/).

I've had the idea to make a website for some while now, and I've finally started to take action.
My idea for this website is to share my perspective as a student aiming to be an analog circuit designer.
I know there are others out there who also share the same goal as me, and I think they will find
this site to be interesting.

Let's get started!
